Yesterday morning, I went to Regal at 14th Union Square to watch the movie "You Only Live Once." Although I had already seen the many clips of the film, it didn't detract from my enjoyment and how deeply moved I was, to the point of crying profusely, in the cinema. The most touching moment for me was when Le Ying was overwhelmingly beaten by the opponent far beyond her strength. It felt like a massive metaphor about life, where the adversary, life itself, is too formidable. Life is inherently a losing game, beating you relentlessly, every punch landing so painfully, hitting you until you fall and struggle to get up again, hitting you to the point where you want to quit the match. But Le Ying did not give up or quit. In life, in reality, there aren't as many victorious moments as in uplifting stories. I appreciate how Jia Ling redefines winning in this movie, showcasing the unique perspective of a female director, free from unrealistic fantasies. Winning is about managing to land a practiced left hook, only to be immediately met with a heavy blow to the face, knocking you down to the floor. That's life—winning is about persistence and not giving up. Jia Ling is such an incredible woman; I was deeply inspired by her after watching the movie. This inspiration is unrelated to physical appearance; it’s the sense of inner strength that truly transforms a person, which is the real key to winning in life.

Because it was a weekday morning, the cinema was somewhat empty, with only four Chinese girls, including me. I could hear the weeping in the room, and when the movie ended, all four of us took out our cell phones and snapped a picture of Jia Ling in her white dress. It was a tender and beautiful moment.
