Over the past week, I have been almost exclusively devoted to reading Fei-Fei Li’s autobiography “The World I See” The inspiration and encouragement I received from it are nothing short of astonishing. Fei-Fei Li came to New Jersey from China at the age of 15, attended a public school, and faced a series of inevitable issues as a first-generation immigrant, including language barriers, bullying targeted at foreign students, and family poverty. As a teenager in high school, she managed to work 12-hour shifts at a Chinese restaurant, and then during her college years, she helped her parents operate the laundry store on weekends. She completed her final exams for her first semester at Princeton outside the operating room where her mother was undergoing heart surgery, yet still managed to achieve the top grades in her class.  

At several crucial junctures in her life - such as after graduating from college and graduate school - Fei-Fei Li faced lucrative job offers from the industry. Despite this, she steadfastly chose the more challenging and uncertain path of science. Fei-Fei has always referred to her passion and calling as her “north star”, because it not only illuminated her path forward and guided her, but also because the north start is always in the distant, unreachable far, much like the pursuit of scientific research, which requires constant advancement yet always remains infinitely distant. In her interviews, Fei-Fei mentioned that she often asks her students what their “north star” is. As a junior researcher in the legal field, I ask myself the same question: What is my north star for my research? What is my calling?

Another reason why this book holds special significance for me is that I am currently working at the intersection of legal studies and AI. Seeing the challenges and solutions that Fei-Fei Li encountered in her early days with data collection and algorithm processing, which were issues she faced 20 years ago, resonates deeply with me. These were the same problems that troubled me over the past year. Following her research path and reflecting upon it made me realize the need to work even harder. To dream big, lay a solid foundation in my work, and to be patient with time and luck. This journey with her research has reinforced the need to have more confidence in the diligent work I am doing.

I feel fortunate to have read this book at this juncture in my life. Fei-Fei Li and her mother exemplify the strong image of Asian women. Fei-Fei’s English, still tinged with a slight accent during public speaking and her visible nervousness, oddly comforts me. Despite her humble tone in writing and her subtle approach to many topics, one can still sense her lively and humorous nature between the lines. She is such a wonderful woman.
